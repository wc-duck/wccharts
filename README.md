What is it?
-----------
WcCharts is a tool to generate charts, surprising right!

> NOTE: HERE BE DRAGONS!

In short it is basically just a wrapper around [QtCharts](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtcharts-index.html) that I wrote out of my own need.
It is REALLY hacky and should not be used by anyone but me, but if you want to give it a try be my guest! It might however be something
in the future... maybe... possibly... if I need it... and have the time!

If you use it anyways, pull-requests might be appreciated... maybe :)
